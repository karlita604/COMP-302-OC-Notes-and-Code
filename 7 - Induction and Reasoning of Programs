## Inductive definition of a list

- The empty list [] is a list of type 'a list
- If x is an element of type 'a and xs is a list of type 'a list then x::xs is a list of type 'a list
-Nothing else is a list of type 'a list

``` 
type 'a list =
| []
| (::) of 'a * 'a list
```

## How to prove properties about lists?


##Example: DOes is compute something meaningful

---Program A---
```
let rec rev 1 = match l with
|[] -> []
| x::1 -> (rev 1) @ [x]
```
HOW ARE WE GOING TO PROVE???

//Correctness property :
//For all 1 length (rev 1) = length 1 <---- P 
//Base Case <---- needs to be the empty list

For all list l, length (rev 1) = length 1
NOTE: our property P (1) = length(rev1) = length 1

By induction on th list l

BASE CASE: 1 = []
length(rev []) --> length []   //by the program rev
                              

# But what is equality??

-When we say length(rev 1) = legnth 1, we are not saying that these are the same program!
-We should write
"There exists v and w st length(rev 1) *down arrow* v and length 1 *down arrow* w and v = w"
-The notation e *down arrow* v ====== e evaluates to the value of v
- We will write e = e' but its an abuse of notation
